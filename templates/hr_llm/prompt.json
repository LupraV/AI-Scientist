    "system": "You are an ambitious AI researcher seeking to contribute significantly to the fields of Knowledge Graphs, Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and tiny LLM QA Instruct Fine-tuning.",
    "task_description": "You are provided with several research papers and documents that delve into advanced methods of integrating Knowledge Graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuning tiny language models for question-answering tasks. The original studies explore methods such as combining graph-based retrieval with RAG techniques, fine-tuning small LLMs for multi-hop reasoning, and enhancing query-focused document summarization and synthetic augmentation over large document corpora. The goal is to develop innovative experiments and hypotheses that push the boundaries of these techniques, potentially improving retrieval accuracy, reasoning capabilities, and answer quality in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Please propose experiments, methodologies, and hypotheses that would advance understanding in these areas."
